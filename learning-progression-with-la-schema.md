## Learning Progression 004: External LEDs

This progression introduces fundamentals of computing, including the binary system of data representation as well as the basics of memory and processing. We introduce assembly language in the context of a minimal instruction set processor. This is where the lowest layer of the software stack and the highest layer of the hardware stack coexist, and where user programs are translated into machine code and executed by the processor one instruction at a time. This is also the level of computing which directly correpsonds to the simplest theoretical models of a computer. We also introduce the input-output capabilities of the micro:bit and build an external circuit to serve as an extension to the built-in 5x5 LED matrix to run our Screensavers program on.

### Step 3: Computation

#### 1. Study
[[toc](#table-of-contents)]

##### Addition
[[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Carry  

```
      .  ....
     101010101
   + 001001111
     ---------
     110010100

Explanation and example from [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17z5Ww1QFLPbbr-kol_xEqEA7ggiUEjZcUP2I2lLfssM/edit#heading=h.tqm2sqa6b8ta).  

##### Shifting   
[[toc](#table-of-contents)]

1. Logical shift.  
2. Arithmetic shift.  
   - Right shift preserves sign.  

##### Multiplication

Addition & shift  
2 2-bit numbers as an example  
```
   10 * 11
   -------
        10
   +   10|
   -------
       110
```

```
   101 * 10101
   -----------
           101
            0|
   +     101||
          0|||
       101||||
   -----------
       1101001
```

```
   10101 * 101
   -----------
         10101
   +        0|
       10101||
   -----------
       1101001
```

**TODO: Table (needed as example for 3.2.4)**  

##### Instruction set architecture
[[toc](#table-of-contents)]

The most basic _operations_ the processor executes. Note that operations are a very high abstraction level relative to electric signals and bit-states, which are part of the physical hardware of the computing device, and thus, the hardware stack. At the same time, operations are the _lowest abstraction level_ in the software stack. This is where the hardware and software stack intersect.

##### Registers
[[toc](#table-of-contents)]

Small number of very fast memory locations, deep inside the processor, used in the execution of the processor's instructions. They hold instructions, operands, results, and control state.


#### 2. Apply
[[toc](#table-of-contents)]

1. `[<lernact-prac>]`Perform _manually_ the operation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=101_{10} - 37_{10}"> in decimal and 2s-complement binary. Show that the results match.    
2. `[<lernact-prac>]`Write a function `addBin(a : string, b : string) : string` to add two binary unsigned integer strings (e.g. `0b00011` and `0b110`) and output (that is, `return`) the result in the same format. Perform the operation `[<cept>]`_bitwise_ and do not convert to and from decimal. Hints and guidelines:
   1. Assume you have unbounded bit width. That is, do not worry about overflow.  
   2. Make sure you align the two strings properly. You might want to `[<cept>]`_pad_ the shorter string, if there is one, before performing the operation.  
   3. Remember binary addition:  
      1. 0<sub>2</sub> + 0<sub>2</sub> = 0<sub>2</sub> and no carry.  
      2. 0<sub>2</sub> + 1<sub>2</sub> = 1<sub>2</sub> and no carry.  
      3. 1<sub>2</sub> + 0<sub>2</sub> = 1<sub>2</sub> and no carry.  
      4. 1<sub>2</sub> + 1<sub>2</sub> = 0<sub>2</sub> and carry of 1<sub>2</sub>.  
3. `[<lernact-prac>]`Perform _manually_ the operation <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=01010110_{2} * 2_{10}"> in binary. Show that it is equivalent to a shift. Specify the type (that is, _direction_ and _bit-distance_) of the shift.  
4. `[<lernact-prac>]`Perform the multiplication of two 3-bit numbers, `0b110` and `0b101`, in a table showing each step.    
5. `[<lernact-prac>]`**[Optional challenge, max 5 extra step points]** Write a function `mulBin(a : string, b : string) : string` to multiply two binary unsigned integer strings (e.g. `0b00011` and `0b110`) and output (that is, `return`) the result in the same format. Perform the operation bitwise and do not convert to and from decimal. Hints and guidelines:
   1. Assume you have 8-bit inputs and you have sufficient output bits. _What is the maximum output bit width of the product of two 8-bit unsigned integers?_  
   2. Make sure you advance your `[<cept>]`_operands_ and `[<cept>]`_accumulator_ properly.    
   3. Remember binary multiplication:  
      1. 0<sub>2</sub> * 0<sub>2</sub> = 0<sub>2</sub>.  
      2. 0<sub>2</sub> * 1<sub>2</sub> = 0<sub>2</sub>.  
      3. 1<sub>2</sub> * 1<sub>2</sub> = 1<sub>2</sub>.  
   4. How would you modify, if necessary, the function to work with 2s-complement signed integers?  
6. `[<lernact-prac>]`**[Optional challenge, max 10 extra step points]** Multiplication of two 16-bit numbers on an 8-bit processor. In particular:
   1. Modify the function from the previous task to work _with 8-bit registers only_. That is, assume that you your operands, intermediate values, and results cannot exceed 8-bit units, and numbers requiring more bits are broken down and stored in arrays of 8-bit number strings.      
   2. The function signature should be `mulBin8(a : string[], b : string[], product : string[]) : void`. The parameter `a` will be an array, representing a 16-bit 2s-complement signed integer, in [big-endian](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/big_endian.html) order. So will `b`. The third operand, `product`, will contain the result of the operation, in the same format.  
   3. Pay special attention to transfering the carry between consecutive bytes of the result, while it is being constructed.
